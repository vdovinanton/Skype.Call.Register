## Usage manual
 - During the program, you must allow access to Skype.

> If you do not want to perform this action every time, then **Toolse -> Options -> Advansed -> Manage other programs Access to Skype** and choose from the list **SkypeWatcher**

## Some trouble with startup

 - If when startup you don't found **Skype4COM.dll** then run [regdll.bat](https://bitbucket.org/vdovinanton/skype.call.register/src/f999f5cb4bd59ead1cb87e819ccf73ae3cd7cecc/Dependencies/?at=master) and rebuild project
